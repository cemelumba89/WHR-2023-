# Understanding Happiness: A Global Perspective (WHR 2023)
The World Happiness Report (WHR), which is “…a partnership of Gallup, the Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and the WHR’s Editorial Board” (World Happiness Report Data Dashboard | The World Happiness Report).  Since its first presentation in April of 2012, The World Happiness Report, has been an instrument for informing various national governments and the interested public about the emerging evidence of the science of happiness and the current state of happiness in the world. The dataset from the WHR 2023 report was the focus of my analysis. (WHR 2023 Data for Table 2.1.xls (*Data set of choice))
# Objective 
As a data analyst, I was tasked with finding and analysis a dataset that I would use to tell a story using the visualization skill that I developed in the use of Tableau during this course. That data set was from The World Happiness Report (WHR). I sought to have my analysis informed by key guideline questions (e.g. Who? What? Where?).
# About the Data 
The World Happiness Report 2023 dataset consists of 11 columns and 2199 rows and contains records for all participating countries across all variables of interest from the years 2005-2022. This includes rating on Life ladder, Log GDP ratio per capita, Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, Perceptions of corruption, Positive affect, and Negative affect. The data used in the formulation of the WHR comes, in part, from Gallup, which made it available to the authors of the report through its World Poll. Another significant data source is the Gallup/Meta State of Social Connections Study. 
# Tools 
The data was analyzed using Python and the libraries relevant to each task that was to be accomplished. Visualizations were created in both Python and Tableau.
# Folders 
The project files are divided between the following folders:
   ● 01 Project Management: Project Brief
   ● 02 Data: Two subfolders: (1) Original Data (2) Prepared Data (Data files for both were not uploaded to GitHub.)
   ● 03 Scripts: Scripts created in Jupyter notebook during analysis  
   ● 04 Analysis: Contains Visualizations
   ● 05 Sent to Client: Contains Portfolio Presentation (WHR 2023 is listed as Project #6)
